# HttpV2 Sink

HttpV2 Sink is implemented in Firehose using the Http sink connector implementation in Depot. You can check out Depot Github repository [here](https://github.com/goto/depot).

### Configuration

For HttpV2 sink in Firehose we need to set first (`SINK_TYPE`=`httpv2`). There are some generic configs which are common across different sink types which need to be set which are mentioned in [generic.md](../advance/generic.md). Http sink specific configs are mentioned in Depot repository. You can check out the Http Sink configs [here](https://github.com/goto/depot/blob/main/docs/reference/configuration/http.md)
